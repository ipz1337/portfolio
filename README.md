## Description

This is a brief description of your application. It's an Express.js application that uses various middleware for functionality such as CORS, sessions, body parsing, cookie parsing, and compression. It also includes a logger and DDoS protection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. The application requires Node.js version 14.0.0 or above.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-link>
2. Install the dependencies
npm install
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill it with your own values based on the `.env.example` file:
PORT=<port_number>
DB_HOST=<database_host>
DB_USER=<database_user>
DB_PASS=<database_password>
DB_NAME=<database_name>
SESSION_SECRET=<session_secret>
APIKEY=<api_key>
CORS_ORIGIN=<cors_origin>
4. Start the server
npm start
For development, you can use:
npm run dev

## Usage

Once the server is running, it will listen on the port specified in your `.env` file. The application's routes are defined in the `routes` directory.

## Error Handling

The application uses a logger to handle errors. All errors are logged in the `error.log` file and all information is logged in the `combined.log` file.
